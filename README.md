## Projects  


### 🛡️ **SOAR & EDR Threat Detection with LimaCharlie**  🛡️
🔹 **Tools Used:** LimaCharlie, Python, SOAR Automation  
🔹 **Key Skills:** Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR), Automated Threat Mitigation, Security Orchestration  
🔹 **Repository:** [🔗 View Project](#)  

📝 **Summary:**  
This project demonstrates how to **integrate LimaCharlie as an EDR solution** to detect and respond to security threats in real-time. I built an automated **Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) workflow**, which included:  

- **Deploying LimaCharlie agents** on Windows and Linux endpoints for real-time monitoring.  
- **Creating automated detection rules** to identify suspicious activities like unauthorized process execution, lateral movement, and privilege escalation.  
- **Configuring automated responses**, such as isolating compromised devices and killing processes.

📌 **Lessons Learned:**  
- How to **deploy and manage EDR agents** efficiently.  
- Writing **custom LimaCharlie rules** for proactive threat detection.  
- Automating incident response using **SOAR playbooks** to reduce reaction time.

### 🛠️ **Vulnerability Scanning & Remediation**  🛠️
🔹 **Tools Used:** Nessus
🔹 **Key Skills:** Vulnerability Assessment, Patch Management, Risk Mitigation  
🔹 **Repository:** [🔗 View Project](#)  

📝 **Summary:**  
I conducted **network vulnerability scans** using Nessus and OpenVAS, identifying **critical security flaws** in a simulated enterprise network. The project covered:  

- **Scanning internal and external hosts** for vulnerabilities (CVE detection).  
- **Assessing risk levels** based on CVSS scores.  
- **Generating security reports** and recommending mitigation strategies.  

📌 **Lessons Learned:**  
- How to interpret **vulnerability scan reports** effectively.  
- The importance of **prioritizing patches** for high-risk CVEs.  
- Understanding **false positives** and verifying findings manually.
