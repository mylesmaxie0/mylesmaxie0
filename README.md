I am a Computing student with a strong interest in Cybersecurity. What excites me most about this field is the constant challenge it presents. Cybersecurity is constantly evolving, requiring continuous learning and adaptation. I am particularly interested in security operations, digital forensics, and incident response. I am currently seeking an internship position as an entry-level cybersecurity analyst to apply my knowledge and gain hands-on experience in these areas.
