# Hello, I'm Miles Maxie

I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computing, with a strong interest in Network Engineering. I have hands-on experience with routing and switching concepts, as well as network automation and scripting in virtual lab environments. I’ve also worked with tools like Wireshark for basic network analysis. I'm passionate about network infrastructure and actively seeking opportunities to apply and further develop my practical skills in real-world settings.
