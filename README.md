Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computing, with a strong interest in the field of Networking. I have hands-on experience with routing and switching concepts in virtual lab environments. Iâ€™ve also worked with tools like Wireshark for basic network analysis. I'm passionate about network infrastructure and actively seeking opportunities to apply and further develop my practical skills in real-world settings.
