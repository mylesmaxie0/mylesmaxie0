### 💻 Technical Projects

#### 🔹Networking Labs

| Lab | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [VLAN Configuration](https://github.com/mylesmaxie0/VLAN-Configuration-Lab) |Learn how to segment a network into multiple Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) to improve performance, security, and manageability. This lab covers VLAN creation, port assignment, and trunking basics. |
| VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol) |Understand how VTP manages VLAN configurations across multiple switches within the same domain, ensuring consistent VLAN information and reducing manual configuration errors. |
| EtherChannel |Configure EtherChannel to bundle multiple physical links into a single logical link, increasing bandwidth and providing redundancy between switches or routers. |
| Inter-VLAN Routing |Set up communication between different VLANs using Layer 3 devices to enable network segmentation with seamless connectivity. |
| Router-on-a-Stick |Implement inter-VLAN routing using a single physical router interface configured with multiple sub-interfaces, each assigned to a different VLAN. |
| Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) |Learn how STP prevents Layer 2 loops in a redundant switched network by automatically blocking and unblocking ports to maintain a loop-free topology. |
| Static Routing |Learn to manually configure routes on routers to control packet forwarding paths, ideal for small or simple network topologies. |
| Routing Information Protocol (RIP) |Configure RIP to enable dynamic routing, allowing routers to automatically share and update routing information based on hop count. |
| Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) |Set up EIGRP to provide efficient, fast-converging, and scalable routing using Cisco’s hybrid distance-vector protocol. |
| Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) |Implement OSPF, a link-state routing protocol that dynamically calculates the shortest and most efficient path for data transmission within large networks. |
| DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) |Configure DHCP to automatically assign IP addresses and other network parameters to hosts, simplifying network management. |
| DNS (Domain Name System) |Set up DNS to translate domain names into IP addresses, enabling user-friendly access to network resources. |
| NTP (Network Time Protocol) |Synchronize device clocks across the network using NTP to ensure accurate timekeeping for logging, authentication, and scheduling. |
| Telnet, SSH, HTTP, HTTPS |Configure and secure remote access and management protocols—Telnet and SSH for command-line access, and HTTP/HTTPS for web-based device management. |
| Access Control List (ACL) |Create and apply ACLs to control traffic flow, enhance network security, and filter packets based on IP addresses, protocols, or ports. |
