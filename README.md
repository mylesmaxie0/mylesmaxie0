# Hello, I'm Miles Maxie

<a href=""><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>

I’m currently working toward my Bachelor of Science in Computing at the University of West Georgia. I’ve earned CompTIA Security+ and Network+ certifications, which have given me a solid foundation in IT fundamentals, security, and networking. I learn new technologies quickly and enjoy solving problems and figuring things out as I go. I’m seeking an IT internship where I can apply my technical skills in a real-world environment and contribute to a dynamic IT team.
